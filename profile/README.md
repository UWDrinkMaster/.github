## 1. High Level Description

The Automated Bartending System is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing the bartending industry. The system automates the drink dispensing and mixing process, reducing wait times and ensuring precise and consistent drink preparation. The project's objective is to create a sophisticated automated bartending system suitable for commercial settings.

### 1.1 Motivation

Traditional bartending often results in long wait times and inconsistent drink quality. Our motivation is to address these issues and provide an efficient, automated solution for bars and restaurants. By eliminating human error and fatigue, the Automated Bartending System guarantees high-quality drinks and improves customer satisfaction.

### 1.2 Project Objective

The main objective of the project is to design and implement a smart bartending system capable of dispensing and mixing different drink recipes accurately. The system will have a user-friendly software interface, allowing customers to customize their drinks, save preferences, and choose from a list of existing cocktails. Additionally, the system will feature age verification, sobriety testing, allergen information, and user authentication to ensure responsible alcohol service.
